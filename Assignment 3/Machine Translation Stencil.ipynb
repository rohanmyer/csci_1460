The primary goal of the assignment is to **implement the transformer yourself**! Outside of this class, you would likely use existing library implementations of Transformers, but for this assignment, we want you to get direct experience with the pieces that go into the full architecture.\n","\n","The main learning objectives for this assignment are to:\n","\n","1. Understand and implement a Transformer\n","2. Understand how a greedy decoding algorithm works and implement a beam search algorithm\n","3. Understand and implement the BLEU metric for evaluating machine translation\n","4. Understand the visualization of decoder attention during translation\n","\n","***Make sure you're using a GPU runtime when you are training the model!*** Go to Runtime > Change runtime type to make sure you are on a GPU runtime when training these models."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tBgSRG1p7ZMq"},"source":["# [DO NOT EDIT] Setup and Data Preprocessing\n","\n","### You only need to **read through** and run this section.
